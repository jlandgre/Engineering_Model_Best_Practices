<xxxPrompt Check intake of background from txt file>
Do you understand the background in Roll_Model_Chat_Prompt.txt

<xxxPrompt initialize test file>
write the import statements for the test file. including setting a path to the project's libs folder to import the RollLength class. Include the requested fixtures

<xxxPrompt add creation of test data>
write an updated version of rl test fixture that uses the pfTestData fixture and which creates the *.csv file saved as pfTestData. It has two columns: length and diameter with two rows: length: [0, 20] and diameter: [40, 120]

<xxxPrompt write .__init__>
write the class .init() method based on the required and optional arguments in the fixture. Remember to use the docstring format from the background

<xxxPrompt write test_init>
write the test for __init__ named as "test_init" function for test_roll_model.py (no repeated underscores in name). In a single test function: instance classes to check two cases:
* case where diam_core is spcified as 50. 
* Also check the case where optional args are not specified

<xxxPrompt Initialize writing the CaliperFromRawData procedure>
We are ready to start writing the CaliperFromRawData procedure. Write the docstring "fence" for the procedure. Remember to indent appropriately and shorten the "===" to fit the 79-character line limit -- for the indent in the class *.py file and no indent in the test file

<xxxPrompt Write first method and its test>
write the .ReadRawData method that reads the data into a new .df_raw attribute
* Add setting it to empty df in .init()) by reading from .file_raw
* Write the test and check that it has two rows with column names length and diam and data values that match df values from rl fixture

Since the __init__ will be updated, output it in one code block and output the method in a separate code block. Repeat the import statements if they change.

<xxxPrompt Write the second method and its test>
Write the AddCalculatedRawCols method and its test. The method should add two columns to .df_raw:
* "diam_m" is diam/1000. to convert mm to m
* "diam_m^2" is diam_m squared check the values. diam_m values according to those in rl fixture df

<xxx Prompt Write the third method and its test>
write the FitRawData method that uses scikit learn to fit a line to the df_raw data
* The x and y variables are diam_m^2 and length respectively
* create new .slope, .intcpt and .R_squared class attributes and initialize them as None in .init
* To make copy/paste easier, output the new .__init__ in its own code block separate from the method
* output the modified import statement in its own code block

Write the test. 
* set x and y numpy arrays from the appropriate .df_raw column .values
* calculate delta_y and delta_x from the individual 2-element array values in x and y
* calculate the slope_expected from delta_y and delta_x
* calculate the intercept_expected from y[1], x[1] and slope_expected
* use np.isclose to check that slope_expected and intercept_expected match hand calculated values of 1562.5 and -2.5 to within +/- 0.001
* use np.isclose to check that .slope, .intcpt and .R_squared from the method match slope_expected, intercept_expected and 1.0 respectively

<xxxPrompt Write the fourth method and its test>
write .CalculateCaliper method that calculates the .caliper attribute in three steps:

caliper_m = pi / (4 * slope)
convert to mm to set caliper_mm
round to 4 decimal places and set .caliper attribute

Output a new __init__ that initializes .caliper as None. Output the method in a separate code block

Write the test
* use a formula to calculate caliper_expected based on 1562.5 slope; multiply by 1000. and round as in the method
* check that caliper_expected matches hand calculated 0.5027 to within 0.0001
* check that .caliper attribute matches caliper_expected to within 0.0001
